# 🍔 Food Truck Locator API
**Team Charter and Team Resume**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Food Truck Locator API** helps users find food trucks in their area based on location and date. It provides an easy way for customers to discover where their favorite food trucks are operating, while also allowing food truck owners to manage their schedules and promote their businesses.

The project follows RESTful API principles and uses Swagger documentation to make endpoints easy to explore and test, similar to [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/).

---

## 🎯 Mission Statement

Our mission is to design a reliable and user-friendly RESTful API that connects food truck owners and customers through accurate, real-time schedule data. We aim to deliver a clean, documented, and maintainable solution that could serve as the backend for a future mobile or web app.
